# Corelix Solutions


**Corelix Solutions** is a modular, automation-first software suite tailored for startups to enterprises. We provide customizable systems for **Accounting, ERP, CRM, POS, Inventory, and HR**—designed for businesses that don’t want to settle for off-the-shelf limitations.

## 🚀 Vision

To empower companies with software that adapts to *them*—not the other way around. Corelix is built with **deep customization**, **modern UI/UX**, and **workflow automation** at its core.

---

## 🧱 Core Modules (In Progress)

- `corelix-hr`: Human Resource Management
- `corelix-crm`: Customer Relationship Management
- `corelix-pos`: Point of Sale
- `corelix-inventory`: Inventory & Stock Flow
- `corelix-accounting`: Ledger & Financials
- `corelix-erp`: Central Command for Ops

Each module is designed to be **plug-and-play**, with standalone repos and shared tooling for rapid prototyping and deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Frontend: `React`, `Vite`, `PWA-first Design`
- Backend: `ExpressJS`, `Prisma`, `MySQL`, `Stripe API`
- Dev Tools: `Turborepo`, `Yarn Workspaces`, `ESLint`, `SWC`
- Infra: Docker-friendly architecture, CI/CD ready

---

## 📖 Philosophy

- **Customization by Default**: Core flows are moldable to your org’s logic and scale.
- **Automation as Leverage**: Repetitive tasks become scheduled flows—from payroll to inventory restocking.
- **Modern Developer Experience**: Clean folder structures, mock data tools, and modular endpoints for faster iteration.
- **Build in Public**: We’re documenting every step—from PRs to product decisions—so others can learn and contribute.
